4. Enforcement and Remedies
Unauthorized use, copying, distribution, or modification of the Materials is strictly prohibited and may result in civil and criminal penalties. The Owner may seek all available remedies under applicable law, including but not limited to injunctive relief, monetary damages, and recovery of attorneys' fees and costs incurred in enforcement.
